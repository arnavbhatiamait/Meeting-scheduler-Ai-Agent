What It Does:
A smart, cross-platform AI agent that:
Schedules meetings (including Google Meet)


Adds and manages tasks via Todoist


Answers questions based on meeting transcripts


Accepts natural voice or text input


Works through Telegram, with WhatsApp support in progress



Key Features:
 LLM-agnostic: Choose between OpenAI, Groq, Gemini, or Ollama


Google Meet Integration: Automatically schedule and fetch meeting links


Transcript Analysis: Reads and reasons over Google Meet transcripts to extract insights


Memory-based Q&A: Ask what was discussed or decided in previous meetings


Todoist API: Manage to-dos and project tasks seamlessly


Voice-enabled: Talk to it using speech recognition


Telegram Bot: Live, chat-based interaction


WhatsApp Integration: In development



Tech Stack:
Python, Streamlit – app logic and UI


LLMs (OpenAI, Ollama, Groq, Gemini) – NLP and planning


Todoist API – task and meeting organization


Google Meet API – schedule meetings, fetch metadata


Transcript Parser – for summarizing and answering follow-up questions


Telegram Bot API – real-time interaction


Speech Recognition – for voice input



Why It Stands Out:
This project brings together agentic LLM capabilities, calendar/task automation, and cross-platform integration—bridging productivity with intelligence:
Replaces a human assistant
Summarizes what was said in a meeting and lets you query it later
Can schedule meeting with the agenda of the meeting
Ask question from the meeting
Analyze what happens in the meeting
Gives a question answer bassed llm bot to answer questions from the transcript
Add different users
Why It Stands Out:
Telegram Bot Integration – from webhook setup to real-time communication


Google Meet and Todoist APIs – handling OAuth, creating meetings, managing tasks


Natural Language Understanding with LLMs – dynamic parsing of user intent


Cross-platform Development – combining Streamlit, bots and Python APIs


Agentic AI Thinking – building systems that reason, recall, and interact like human assistants
